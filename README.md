# ⚡ Household Power Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes household electricity consumption data to uncover usage patterns and predict future energy demands using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand power usage trends
- Handle missing values and clean data
- Build regression models to predict energy consumption
- Evaluate and compare model performance

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install required packages:
3. Run the notebook:
Open `power_consumption_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.

## 📈 Results

The notebook includes visualizations, feature importance, and model evaluation for energy forecasting. The best performance was achieved using the XGBoost model.

## 📁 Dataset

Data used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
